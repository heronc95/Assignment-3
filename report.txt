Team 11:

Andrew Beckwith, bandrew1@vt.edu
Was responsible for the LED, main server, mongodb and authentication. 

Tanner Williams, tanner12@vt.edu
Responsible for writing the custom api, as well as the example.py and 
everything along with that

Carter Heron, heronc95@vt.edu 
Responsible for the canvas interface with upload and download.

Unusual Configurations:


The custom api is all about timezones, so we used a python library to get
those, which needs to be installed
For the custom.py you need to install pytz
Need to do pip3 install pytz 

The led and custom advertise themselves over zeroconf by opening a port to
8.8.8.8 to get the outbound IP address to connect to. This is so that the 
server pi can find the address to get to it. 

The example python file also is invoked by


Server listens on 5000
python3 example.py -a <ipaddressofserver> -p <portit is listeningon>
